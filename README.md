# Build_Paraview_Animations
C/C++ snippets for saving 2D &amp; 3D temporal structured data into HDF5 format. 

I also give example routines for creating their associated XDMF scheme, i.e. the *.xmf files, needed for loading the data into Paraview.

Following this snippets and with the help of paraview, one can create the following animations:

## 2D Structured data animated

## 3D Structured data animated

Happy coding !!
